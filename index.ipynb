    "Let's define a `Ride`, `Driver`, and `Passenger` class as these are all crucial parts to a single ride. We have provided files for you aptly named ride.py, driver.py, and passenger.py where you can define the appropriate classes. Below, we import the classes from those files so we can use them in our code. The import syntax in Python is as follows: the keyword `from` followed by the name of the file then the keyword `import` and finally the name of the object we are importing (i.e. `from` `[filename]` `import` `[object_name]`). The first import is done for you, follow its example to import the other two classes.\n",

Don't worry about it right now, but know that it is just updating our imported code. To run it, remove the below `#`s and run the cell. After running the cell, add the `#`s back **before** running your tests as the `%` operator will cause errors."
